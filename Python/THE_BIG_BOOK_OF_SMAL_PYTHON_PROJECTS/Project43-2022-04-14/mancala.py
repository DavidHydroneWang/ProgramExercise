          Mancala, by Al Sweigart al@inventwithpython.com
          The ancient two-player seed-sowing game. Grab the seeds from a pit on
          your side and place one in each following pit, going counterclockwise
          and skipping your opponent's store. If your last seed lands in an empty
          pit of yours, move the opposite pit's seeds into that pit. The
          goal is to get the most seeds in your store on the side of the board.
          If the last placed seed is in your store, you get a free turn.

          The game ends when all of one player's pits are empty. The other player
          claims the remaining seeds for their store, and the winner is the one
          with the most seeds.
